# Description

The goal of this level is for you to hack the basic [DEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange) contract below and steal the funds by price manipulation.

You will start with 10 tokens of `token1` and 10 of `token2`. The DEX contract starts with 100 of each token.

You will be successful in this level if you manage to drain all of at least 1 of the 2 tokens from the contract, and allow the contract to report a "bad" price of the assets.

 

Quick note
Normally, when you make a swap with an ERC20 token, you have to `approve` the contract to spend your tokens for you. To keep with the syntax of the game, we've just added the approve method to the contract itself. So feel free to use `contract.approve(contract.address, <uint amount>)` instead of calling the tokens directly, and it will automatically approve spending the two tokens by the desired amount. Feel free to ignore the `SwappableToken` contract otherwise.

  Things that might help:

- How is the price of the token calculated?
- How does the `swap` method work?
- How do you `approve` a transaction of an ERC20?
